For the **Wealth Weaver** personal finance management tool, **FaaS (Function-as-a-Service)** is the most suitable choice, followed by **SaaS** components for specific use cases, while **IaaS** would be less optimal. 

---

### **Why FaaS is Best for Core Features**
1. **Event-Driven Architecture Matches Key Requirements**  
   - Features like **real-time spending insights**, **automated alerts**, and **transaction categorization** align perfectly with FaaS's event-triggered execution model. For example:
     - A budget-exceeded event → Triggers an alert function.
     - A new transaction → Triggers categorization and logging functions.  
     - *Cost Efficiency*: Pay only when functions execute (ideal for sporadic user actions like alerts or data syncs)[1][7].

2. **Granular Scalability**  
   - FaaS auto-scales individual functions (e.g., transaction processing during peak hours) without over-provisioning entire servers. This ensures:
     - Handling **thousands of concurrent users** during financial data syncs or end-of-month budget updates[1][7].
     - Reduced idle costs compared to running always-on servers[1][7].

3. **Microservices Compatibility**  
   - Wealth Weaver’s **microservices architecture** (stated in non-functional requirements) benefits from FaaS:
     - Decouple services like account aggregation, notifications, and spending analysis into independent functions[7][9].
     - Simplify updates (e.g., modifying the categorization algorithm without redeploying the entire app)[7].

4. **Security and Compliance**  
   - FaaS providers (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) handle infrastructure security, encryption, and compliance with financial standards (e.g., PCI DSS), reducing development overhead[8].

---

### **Where SaaS Complements FaaS**
1. **Third-Party Integrations**  
   - Use SaaS solutions for non-core features to reduce development time:
     - **Account Aggregation**: Leverage SaaS APIs like Plaid or Yodlee[6][9].
     - **Fraud Detection**: Integrate SaaS tools like Sift or Sardine[3][8].

2. **Financial Reporting**  
   - SaaS-based analytics platforms (e.g., Tableau Embedded) can handle dashboards for budgeting and trend analysis, reducing backend complexity[6][8].

---

### **Why IaaS is Less Optimal**
1. **Overhead for Scaling**  
   - IaaS requires manual scaling of servers/VMs, which is inefficient for fluctuating workloads (e.g., sudden spikes during tax season)[10].

2. **Higher Operational Costs**  
   - Paying for idle servers (e.g., overnight low-usage periods) conflicts with Wealth Weaver’s cost-efficiency goals[1][10].

3. **Maintenance Burden**  
   - IaaS demands in-house management of OS updates, security patches, and disaster recovery—distracting from core financial features[7][10].

### **Decision: Hybrid FaaS + SaaS**
| **Component**          | **Service Model** | **Reason**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction Processing  | FaaS              | Event-driven, scalable, and cost-efficient for real-time actions[1][7].    |
| Account Aggregation     | SaaS (Plaid/Yodlee) | Prebuilt APIs reduce development time and compliance risks[6][9].          |
| Budgeting Analytics     | SaaS (Embedded BI) | Leverage existing tools for dashboards instead of rebuilding[5][8].         |
| Notifications           | FaaS              | Trigger SMS/email alerts via serverless functions (e.g., Twilio/SendGrid)[1]. |
| Backend Infrastructure  | IaaS (Optional)   | Only if strict data residency requirements exist (otherwise use FaaS)[10]. |

### **Cost Efficiency Comparison**
| Model  | Pros for Wealth Weaver                     | Cons                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **FaaS** | - Zero idle costs<br>- Auto-scaling[1][7] | - Cold starts during sudden spikes    |
| **SaaS** | - Rapid deployment[5][8]                 | - Limited customization               |
| **IaaS** | - Full infrastructure control[10]        | - High maintenance costs[10]         |

---

### **Conclusion**
FaaS provides the **best balance of scalability, cost efficiency, and alignment with event-driven features** like real-time insights and alerts. Supplementing with SaaS for non-core tasks (e.g., analytics) accelerates development. IaaS should only be used if regulatory requirements mandate full infrastructure control.
